ubuntu-report (1.0.9) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Use vendoring instead of relying on build-deps (LP: #1764961):
    - ship vendor as part of the source package and remove build-deps
    - update debian/copyright to list vendored deps.
    - ensure that golang-github-ubuntu-ubuntu-report-dev is still
      depending on the packages deps and don't ship vendor deps to avoid
      nested vendoring: we want developers using the bindings to have
      the choice between distro version or their own vendored version.
